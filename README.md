# Video Scroller
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
Video Scroller allows you to scroll through a video to view it, adjusting the playback speed of the video to your scroll speed. You can select from either 2 example videos, or upload your own video. 

This can be used to make slow-mo/reverse playback effects, as well as making it easier to observe quick movements in videos.

This website was made with HTML, CSS and Javascript. To create the video scrolling effect, I used the ScrollTrigger and GSAP Javascript libraries. 

This project is currently available at https://adncwy.github.io/video-scroller/ and can be used on your phone or computer.
